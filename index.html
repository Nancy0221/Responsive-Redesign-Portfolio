      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        In this assignment, a responsive redesign was carried out on the
        original webpage, which improved the problems of low contrast, unclear
        text, repeated buttons, unclear partitions and adaptability to various
        screen sizes.

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of this assignment is to make the text on the page clearer
        and readable through improvements, allowing users to go to the desired
        section through the navigation bar, and allowing the web page to be
        displayed well on any screen size.

          <li>
            Write a sentence about why you chose this website: I chose this
            website because it is a food ordering website and many people may
            use it, so improvements to it may enhance the experience for lots of
            users.

          On the home page of the website, the contrast between image and text
          is low.
        </li>
        <li>
          The location of some buttons on this website is redundant. For
          example, user can go to menu by clicking the picture of the food, but
          there also has a button below the picture.
        </li>
        <li>
          This home page can be set a side bar at the top of so that users can
          go to different parts in the same page by clicking the button on the
          side bar.

      <h3>Usability & Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        WebAIM WAVE's diagnosis shows that the contrast between the pictures and
        text on the homepage of the website is low. Secondly, when the menu is
        displayed, the contrast between the yellow font and the black background
        is also low. Also, there are very few places where the first level
        heading and form tags are missing, and there are even a few empty links
        on the bottom images. I agree with these diagnoses because I also
        noticed these issues when I first viewed the page. In addition, the lack
        of labels may cause reading difficulties for blind readers, such as the
        inability to recognize main headings and tables. Finally, I think that
        the images without appropriate link can be deleted to prevent users from
        misunderstanding the use of these images.

      <div class="text1">
        <p>
            <h4>Step 1: </h4>
          Redesign the side bar so that user can use it to navigate the
          content they want to see.
        </p>
        <p style="color: #8338ec;">
          <i>A surprising finding</i>: Dark backgrounds sometimes make it
          difficult to see light text. Only a dark background that is not
          cluttered can create a sharp contrast with light text.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="pic1">

    <div class="dp2">
        <h4>Step 2: </h4>
      <p>Increasing the contrast between background and text.</p>
      <p style="color: #8338ec;">
        <i>For readers</i>: A light-colored background can also allow them to
        see the content of the picture clearly.
      </p>
      <h4 style="color: #d62828;">Before:</h4>
      <img src="img/image4.png" alt="before" />

        Showing the introduction of the food not the button below the
        picture. The user still can access the order page by clicking the
        picture of the food.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #8338ec;">
        <i>Interesting fact</i>: When I show people the page, they tend to click
        on the image rather than the button below.

        Using black instead of grey for the ingredients text to increase the
        visibility. Also, I changed the color of the checked mark so the people
        who cannot see the "Configure" clearly can also know the meaning of this
        blue button.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #8338ec;">
        <i>Interesting finding</i>: Increasing contrast helps readers notice the
        content at first glance.

      <p>Using the blue bar with title to divide different partitions.</p>
      <p style="color: #8338ec;">
        <i>For readers</i>: Clear partitions make them more aware of the
        structure of the web page, and also allow them to browse to the parts
        they want to read more quickly.

        Separate the text and background picture so the user can see both of
        them clearly. In addition, I added responsive design for the new
        webpage. The upper one is for large screen (desktop and tablet), and the
        bottom one is for small screen (phone).
      </p>
      <p style="color: #8338ec;">
        <i>Interesting experience</i>: The original design may not allow readers
        to see the ingredients clearly, but they can clearly see the price at
        the first glance. Readers will be more willing to pay for the burger if
        they can be convinced that the burger is worth the price by first
        reading the ingredients. So that's the reason for I made the text and
        picture separately.

        Using the dark part of the picture for the background when the user's
        screen size is relatively small to enhance the readability.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #8338ec;">
        <i>Surprising discovery</i>: If the pattern on the edge of the picture
        may cause difficulty in reading the text, this can be improved by taking
        only the middle part of the picture. This also ensures that the
        background image has a unified style.
